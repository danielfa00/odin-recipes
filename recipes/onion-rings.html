    <h1>Onion Rings</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Onion rings</b> are a popular appetizer at many restaurants, and with this 
        recipe, you can satisfy your craving at home. This is an actual recipe 
        from a former employee of a popular drive-in restaurant. Sweet and tender 
        on the inside, crispy and crunchy on the outside â€” just like the pros make!
